# **Leaf Infection Detection and Analysis Using Digital Image Processing**
This project focuses on detecting and highlighting infected areas on a leaf image. It analyzes the extent of infection and provides a detailed infection report based on image processing techniques.

## **Key Features**:
**Infection Detection:** Highlights the infected regions in the leaf.

**Infection Analysis:** Calculates the number of pixels affected and the overall percentage of leaf infection.

**Histogram Visualization:** Displays the histogram of the infected leaf image.

**User-Friendly GUI:** An interactive and extensive web-based GUI built using Streamlit for easy usage and visualization.

## **Tools and Libraries Used:**
**OpenCV (cv2)** – for image processing tasks.

**Streamlit** – to build an interactive web application.

**NumPy** – for efficient numerical and pixel-based operations.

**Matplotlib** – for visualizing histograms and graphical outputs.
